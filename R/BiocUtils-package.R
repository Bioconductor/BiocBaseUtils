#' BiocUtils: Utility functions for developing Bioconductor packages
#'
#' BiocUtils attempts to formalize often written developer functions that
#' are scattered throughout the Bioconductor ecosystem. Some of these functions
#' include the ability to replace slots in an object. Other functions work
#' to create a nice show method output by selecting some observations. This
#' package also allows developers to check what emails are associated with
#' what packages.
